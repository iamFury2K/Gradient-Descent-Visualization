Gradient Descent Optimization in 3D
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the concept of gradient descent, a popular optimization technique used in machine learning and numerical optimization. In this example, the gradient descent algorithm is applied to a 3D surface defined by a mathematical function, with the goal of finding the minimum (or maximum) value of the function.

How it Works
The core idea behind this demonstration is to iteratively update the current position on the 3D surface by following the direction of the negative gradient. Here's a step-by-step overview of the process:

A 3D surface is created based on a given mathematical function using NumPy and Matplotlib.
The gradient of the function is calculated at the current position (x, y) using the calc_gradient function.
The current position is updated by subtracting a small fraction (learning rate) of the gradient in both the x and y directions.
The updated position is plotted on the 3D surface, showing the movement towards the minimum (or maximum) value.
The process is repeated for a specified number of iterations (in this case, 1000 iterations).
How to Use
To run this code and visualize the gradient descent optimization:

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Install the required packages, including NumPy and Matplotlib, if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
Clone this repository or download the gradient_descent_3d.py file.

Open the gradient_descent_3d.py file in a Python environment or IDE.

Run the script.

You will see a 3D plot showing the movement of the optimization algorithm on the surface of the function. The magenta-colored point represents the current position during each iteration, and you'll observe how it approaches the minimum (or maximum) value of the function over the iterations.

Feel free to modify the function, calc_gradient, and other parameters to explore different functions and optimization behaviors. This script serves as a visual aid to understand the basic concept of gradient descent in a 3D context.

Additional Notes
This code is a simple example intended for educational purposes, and it may not be suitable for complex functions or advanced optimization tasks. The learning rate and the number of iterations are fixed in this example; in practice, you might need to adjust these parameters for better convergence.

For more advanced optimization tasks, you might want to explore libraries like SciPy, which provide powerful optimization algorithms capable of handling various scenarios.

Enjoy experimenting with gradient descent in 3D!
